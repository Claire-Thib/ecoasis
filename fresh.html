      Lakes

      <p id="hot">
        Lakes are a body of water surrounded
        by land, each varying in size. Light and
        wind affect the temperature in lakes,
        sunlight makes it warmer wind makes it
        cool down. The changing temperatures
        are really affecting the fishes, with the
        earlier snowmelt, rising amounts of percipitation
        more frequent floods. They affect the temperature,
        reproduction, creates a ton of dead zones, and
        creates a displacement of cold-water species

        Ponds
        </p>

        <p id="semi">
          A pond is a small area of still,
          fresh water. It's different from lakes
          and rivers because the water is still.
          With the droughts and all the temperature
          changes ponds could dry out faster. Which<
          impacts the reproductive cycles of
          numerous amphibian species.

          Inland Wetlands
          </p>

          <p id="coast">
            Inland Wetlands are most common on
            floodplains along rivers and streams
            surrounded by dry land. There are
            marshes and wet meadows dominated by
            herbaceous plants, swamps dominated by
            shrubs. Inland wetlands can be vulnerable
            to the impacts of climate. They also play an
            important role through capturing and storing
            carbon to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

            <p id="river">
            Rivers
            </p>

            <p id="co">
              Rivers come from many different sources.
              They can start from lakes or springs
              and from rain or melting snow.
              With the rising temps rivers are starting
              to dry out. It affects the water quality,
              wetland plants and animals, and biodiversity loss.
