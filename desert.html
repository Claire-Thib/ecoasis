      Hot and Dry Deserts
      </p>

      <p id="hot">
        Hot and Dry Deserts have very high temperatures year-round,
        having very low humidity levels. Rainfall is very sparse
        and evaporation rates are very high. Plants in this desert
        include mostly small shrubs and short, woody trees. The
        animals include small nocturnal carnivores, reptiles, and birds,
        many of which hide during the day from the piercing sun
        and come out during the night to hunt or forage.

        <p id="semiarid">
        Semiarid Deserts
        </p>

        <p id="semi">
          Semiarid deserts are deserts that are are normally hot and dry,
          but have a low concentration of rainfall in the winter. The spiny
          nature of many of the plants protect the crops from the hazardous
          environment that is the Semi-arid desert. Many animals find protection
          underground to help them protect themselves from the oppressive
          heat that is present during the day.

          <p id="coastal">
          Coastal Deserts
          </p>

          <p id="coast">
            Coastal Deserts are moderately cool to warm and
            are located near the coast. The soil is usually fine-textured
            and contains a moderately high salt-content. Many of the plants
            have large root systems near the surface so they can absorb
            much of the moisture produced from rain showers.


            <p id="cold">
            Cold Deserts
            </p>

            <p id="co">
              Cold Deserts have extremely cold winters, warm or hot
              summers, and low precipitation levels. Specific plants
              and animals have certain adaptation that help them stay
              cool and have enough water to survive. The winters
              receive a lot of slow and the plants are widely scattered
              in the area.
