<p id="chaps">
Chaparrals are found in most continents such as the <br>
west coast of the United States, the west coast of South <br>
America, the Cape Town area of South Africa, the western tip <br>
of Australia and the coastal areas of the Mediterranean. <br>
Each chaparral is different, some are flat plains while <br>
others can have rocky hills and mountain slopes. Their climate <br>
is usually very hot in the summer reaching a temp of 40˚C (104˚F) and in <br>
the winter it's 10˚C (50˚K). Because of the weather droughts <br>
and fires are very common in that area, but fortunately the animals and <br>
plants adapted to the conditions. Chaparrals are getting destroyed by man made <br>
fires and pollution, especially in California. The fires can be prevented but <br>
as for the pollution there is no easy fix. But, we can start doing things <br>
some everday tasks differently to help stop it from getting worse. Such as, <br>
reducing our energy uses. Light energy really effects the animals in these biomes. <br>
Start using energy efficient cars, carpooling.  <br>
