  Tropical Rainforests
  </p>

  <p id="trop">
    Tropical Rainforests are located near the equator, since that is where
    hot, moisture filled air is dumped. These forests have a year-round
    high moisture levels, uniformly warm temperature, and high rainfall.
    Tropical rainforests are dominated by broadleaf evergreen plants, which
    keep most of their leaves year-round. Tropical rainforests have very
    high net primary productivity, since there are many different species
    with lots of biological biodiversity. They cover only 2% of the Earth's >
    surface, but they contain at least half of the the earth's known terrestrial
    plant and animal species. Most of the nutrients are stored within the plants
    and not the soil since right as nutrients are released, they are taken up by the plants.
    Half of all tropical forests have been destroyed or disturbed by human activites
    for agricultural or urban development purposes.

  Deciduous Rainforests
  </p>

  <p id="de">
    Deciduous Rainforests are located in aread with average temperatures that change
    dramatically between each season. This forest is dominated with broad-broadleaf
    deciduous trees like oak, hickory, and maple trees. The flora survives by dropping
    all of its leaves during the fall and then becoming dormant during the winter season.
    In this forest, there is a very slow rate of decomposition, so layers of leaf
    litter decay on the ground, holding much nutrients. Deciduous forests have been disturbed
    more than any other forest or biome in the world.

  Coniferous Rainforests
  </p>

  <p id="con">
    Coniferous Rainforests are cold forests that are dominated by evergreen,
    coniferous trees such as spruce, fir, and cedar. Most of these plants have
    narrow leaves (needles) which helps the crops withstand the harsh, cold
    year-round temperatures. These forests are found south of the arctic tundra in Northern
    regions all around the world. There is very low plant and animal biodiversity
    because few species can survive the winters when the soil moisture freezes.
    A specific type of coniferous forest is a boreal forest, which is also called
    a taiga. Here is more information on <a href="taiga.html">taigas</a>.

Forests currently cover 30% of the world's land area, but that number is dramatically
decreasing. Forests are extremely important because they act as a carbon sink to help
absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (and that we release in many different
processes like smelting and mining) and also help absorb the heat that is produced
during the greenhouse effect. Forests also hold a large majority of the species
the Earth and have high biodiversity levels. The main causes of deforestation are clearing
for farming, grazing of livestock, mining, drilling, forestry practices, wildfires, and
urbanization.
