      These before and after pictures of our Earth's oceans helps to descibe
      the impact that humans are having on our oceans. Specifically, this page<br>
      we are going to be focused on the impact the plastic has on our environment.
      Every aspect of plastic has a harmful impact on the environment: the creation of <br>
      plastics, its usage, and its disposal all harms either certain
      organisms (like humans and animals) or the Earth.

             Plastics are made to last forever. Plastic is not <br>
             biodegradabe; it is photodegradable, meaning that plastic <br>
             never disappears, but instead just breaks up into smaller <br>
             smaller pieces called microplastics. The small plastic <br>
             fragments are easily absorbed by water and soil and <br>
             easily digested by people and animals.

              Every square mile of ocean has 46,000 pieces of plastic <br>
              floating on it. This is why over a million sea birds,<br>
              whales, seals, dolphins, sea turtles, and more die from <br>
              the plastic debris that is ending up in our oceans. <br>
              Aquatic animals become entangled in plastic or they eat it<br>
              or mistake it for food and feed it to their young. In our <br>
              oceans, plastic debris outweighs zooplankton by a ratio <br>
              of 36-to-1.

             Chemicals added to plastics are absorbed by humans and <br>
             are now found in the blood and tissue of everybody. <br>
             Exposure to these chemicals such as phthalates, which are found <br>
             in food packaging and wall coverings, and bisphenol A (BPA),<br>
             which is found in water bottles and beverage cans, can leach into <br>
             food and drink and poison humans, causing ailments such as cancer <br>
             birth defects, and hormone disruption.

             The plastic industry produces 400 million tons of plastic a year, <br>
             but only 9% gets recycled. Many plastic products are sitting <br>
             in landfills, burned, or thrown into the ocean. Heavily popular <br>
             today is single use plastic products, which unnecessarily produces <br>
             an abundant amount of trash. The toxic chemicals present within <br>
             the plastics many times leach and soak into the surrounding soil, <br>
             bodies of water, or groundwater supplies.

             The United States production of plastic alone uses 331 billion <br>
             barrels of petroleum, which is 5% of the national consumption <br>
             of petroleum. Petroleum has very harmful effects, both from mining <br>
             it and from burning it to make electricity. For more information <br>

            Many different industries suffer and are costed billions of dollars <br>
            because of plastic pollution. Tourism, recreation, business, the <br>
            health of humans, animals, fish and birds are all harmed and <br>
            destroyed because of the plastic that humans manufacture and <br>
            improperly dispose of. To marine environmentments alone, plastic <br>
            costs $13 billion in economic damage each year.

        <h2> The Great Pacific Garbage Patch</h2>

       The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a collection of marine debris that is <br>
       floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The litter is held withing one <br>
       area because of an ocean gyre, which is a system of circular currents. <br>
       Much of the trash that gets trapped is not biodegradble; instead most of <br>
       the trash breaks up into microplastics. Many people imagine the Great <br>
       Pacific Garbage Patch as a mile high pile of trash. It is actually, a <br>
       large part of the ocean that holds hundreds of thousands of pieces of <br>
       microplastics. Many marine animals end up ingesting these pieces of <br>
       plastics and then humans end up eating these animals.
