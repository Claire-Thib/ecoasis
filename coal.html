  <p id="nonrenewb"> Coal has enabled the production of affordable energy, it <br>
    has been a primary choice to build power plants around the <br>
    world. Some pros of coal energy is the abundance of coal supply, <br>
    huge potenital as opposed to oil, wide industrial base (coal reapidly <br>
    spread in many places around the world). But, coal releases carbon <br>
    dioxide which leads to the effect of gloabl warming. Also, coal mining has <br>
    resulted to the deaths of thousands year after year (not only occured in <br>
    places without saftey regulations such as China but also in the US and <br>
    New Zealand.) Areas near coal mines has been destroyed (habitat of animals <br>
    and many peoples properties.) <br>
