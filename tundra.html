  Tundra
  </p>

  <p id="tu">
    Arctic tundras, also called cold grasslands, usually lie south of the Arctic
    polar ice caps. The area is bitterly cold most of the year so thre are not many
    tall trees and plants because they can not survive in the cold and windy tundra.
    Most of the annual growth of the tundra's plants (which are mostly grasses,
    mosses, and lichens) happen in the 7 to 8 week summer, where the sun shines
    almost all day. Since it is extremely cold, permafrost, which is underground soil
    that contains water that stays frozen for years and also acts as a carbon sink, forms.
    Animals in this biome have very thick coats of fur (such as the arctic wolf or the arctic
    fox) and feathers or live undrground because of the intense cold. An increasing
    problem is that the permafrost is the melting permafrost, which releases the stored
    carbon dioxide and damages infrastructure that is built on top of it.
